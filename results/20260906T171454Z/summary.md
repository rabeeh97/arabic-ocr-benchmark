# Benchmark summary — `20260906T171454Z`

CER/WER/MER/WIL: lower is better. CAR/WIP: higher is better. `micro` = corpus-weighted, `macro` = per-sample mean.
`exact` = fraction of samples transcribed perfectly. `diac_f1` = harakat F1 (raw text).
Full per-metric, per-profile numbers (CAR / MER / WIL / WIP too) are in `summary.csv`; see `docs/metrics.md` for definitions.
